## Introduction

IPL is a professional Twenty20 cricket league in India. It has become one of the most popular cricket leagues in the world attracting top players from around the globe. In this project, I have analyzed the IPL Dataset spanning from 2008 to 2020, utilizing the data visualization tool Tableau. The goal is to analyze the performance of both players and teams over the years. By creating interactive dashboard, we can identify trends and patterns that can help us to make informed decisions about strategy and player selection.


## Dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/pranjalverma08/detailed-analysis-of-ipl-data-2008-2020/data)

This dataset consists of two seperate CSV files : matches and deliveries. These files contain the information of each match summary and ball by ball details, respectively.
It contains the match descriptions, results, winners, player of the matches, ball by ball dataset and much more

## Tools used-

Tableau and Excel

## Key metrics displayed in the dashboard include-

* Winner, Orange Cap, Purple Cap, Tournament 4's and Tournament 6's
* Toss Decision Percentage
* No of matches win based on toss decision
* Batting Stat
* Bowling Stat

## The dashboard allows filtering by season.
